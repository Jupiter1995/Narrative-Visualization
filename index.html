            Background
        </h3>
        <p>
            On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19, 
            the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2, a pandemic. The announcement followed a rising sense of alarm in the preceding months over a new, 
            potentially lethal virus that was swiftly spreading around the world. </br></br>
            
            Two year later, we look back on one of the most challenging periods in recent memory. During this challenging periods, 
            many countries have to made hard decision between health and economic. In the meantime, the global political landscape has changed dramatically
            while the pandemic was going. So here, the five most powerful countries in the world, <strong>US, UK, France, Russia and China</strong>, Permanent Members in the Security Counncil of UN, will be shown. In addition, they had a lot 
        histories with each other, especially the protagonists of today's world, <strong>US and China</strong><br></br>
             
            Going forward, We will focus on the infection rate solely. Looking at the infection rate may
    provide us some unseen facts about the countries.</br>

            Introduction 
        </h3>
        <p>
            As well known, China chooses the most restricted policy in order to control the spread of the virus. While US, UK and France were back and forth with their policies. 
            This leads to a huge difference in infection rate. <br>
            In the interative chart below, you could see that the country with the <strong>highest infection rate</strong> is highlighted in <strong>red</strong>. US was the country with 
            the highest infection rate until 2022. China barely had some infections. You could play around with the <strong>years</strong> and observe the different 
            change trends in difference countries, and then rethink about the policies in those countries.
