        <h3>
            Background
        </h3>
        <p>
            On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19, 
            the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2, a pandemic. The announcement followed a rising sense of alarm in the preceding months over a new, 
            potentially lethal virus that was swiftly spreading around the world. </br></br>
            Two year later, we look back on one of the most challenging periods in recent memory. During this challenging periods, many countries have
            to made hard decision between health and economic. Here, we will look back and focus on the fection rate solely among five most powerful countries
            in the world, which are the permanent members in The Security Conuncil of UN - <strong>US, UK, France, Russia and China</strong>. </br> 
        </p>

        <h3>
            Introduction 
        </h3>
        <p>
            As well known, China chooses the most restricted policy in order to control. While US, UK and France were back and forth with their policies. 
            This leads to a huge difference in infection rate. <br>
            In the interative chart below, you could see that the country with the <strong>highest infection rate</strong> is highlighted in <strong>red</strong>. US was the country with 
            the highest infection rate until 2022. China barely had some infections. You could play around with the <strong>years</strong> and observe the different 
            change trends in difference countries, and then rethink about the policies in those countries.
